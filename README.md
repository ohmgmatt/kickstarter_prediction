# Springboard Capstone 1
## Prediction of Kickstarter Projects
Kickstarter is a crowdsourcing platform where Creators can upload their projects for users to back their project. Many successful projects come from this. However, there is an issue where only 33% of Kickstarters are successfully backed. In this project, we'll be determining what features about a project lead to success and creating a model that predicts if a project will fail. The goal is to provide information to potential Creators on the success of their projects and if they need to go back and work on their pitch.
